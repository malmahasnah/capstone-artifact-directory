Title:
<A Causal Approach to Understanding Student Depression>

Abstract:
<Our project aims to establish a framework for the root causes of depression,
specifically for students. To do this, we utilize various causal mechanisms to
investigate and analyze features that could potentially be directly related to
depression. While past projects have focused on uncontrollable factors, our
goal is to focus on modifiable aspects. The ultimate goal here is to under-
stand exactly what aspects of a potential student’s life may be contributing to
depression, and set a foundation to make improvements and emphasize the
importance of providing targeted resources for students’ mental health.>
